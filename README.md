# Assignment-5-Calendar

For this weeks assignment we are tasked to create a personal day manager, allowing the user to log what they want to achieve for the day/what they have planned. This needs to be saved so when they refresh the page, they can see whats on/to do. 

As a part of this assignment, the HTML and CSS was provided, aswell as relevent libraries were already linked. I started by setting up a bunch of divs, that were set up in containers to allow my days to be shown on the screen. Using the Ids and classes already given to me by the linked bootstrap css, I was quickly able to get my HMTL looking a lot like the mock up from the start, which made coding in the functionaility a lot easier.

I then got my save button working, and started by getting the element of my save button and then setting up a function that would take any value written in the text section, and save it to the div within the specified time. Next these required to be saved into local storage, so that the user could refresh the page and their saved results would display. this functionality was easily set up once, then applied to all individually. 

Lastly I set up the final functionality of having all the different times update with a colour in the background, so that it made it easier for the user to see what hour of the day it is, so that they can easily see what task they are up to for what hour.
